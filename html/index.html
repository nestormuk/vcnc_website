                        Our journey began with our founder's simple yet profound gesture of connecting with street 
                        children through the universal language of music. Playing guitar for emotional healing, visiting 
                        the families of those who had them, and listening to their stories, our founder laid the foundation 
                        for what would become a thriving community dedicated to the well-being of vulnerable children.

                        During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to help these street children intensified even further. 
                        More children were exposed to poverty, more families fell unable to cater for their offsprings, 
                        which all contributed to an increase of street children and school dropouts.

                        The founder reached out to like-minded youths to organize a christmas day which took place on 
                        December 26, 2024, where 34 street children were hosted.
                        This marked the birth of VCNC. The attendees were inspired by the dreams the kids had, and the 
                        desire to transform their lives. It was immediately concluded to take the most promising kids 
                        back to school, encourage them to go back to their families, and provide basic needs they faced 
                        regularly.

                    <p>VCNC is dedicated to providing holistic support to young, vulnerable children facing adversity.
                        Our mission is to empower these children by addressing challenges such as addiction to drugs
                        (those already on street), limited access to education, and insufficient basic needs through
                        creative initiatives, community engagement, and collaborative fundraising efforts. We strive to
                        create a positive impact on their lives.</p>

                        Our vision is to build a society that prioritizes the well-being and education of these children,
                        providing them with the support and opportunities needed for a brighter and more promising
